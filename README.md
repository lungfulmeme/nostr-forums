# nostr-forums
**Proof of Concept** - forums based on nostr protocol using [NIP-72](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md#nip-72) as an **unmoderated** public community group. Community clients (forum websites) become the moderators, therefore if users feel there is unfair censorship they are free to move to another client (different forum website). Discussion is not lost as the notes are unmoderated. No gatekeepers.

## What's needed:
 - Community groups are set up that have no moderators/administrators
 - Proposal for change to NIP-72 for the ability for any user to create sub-community/nested groups for topics (main community group could be displayed as under 'General' thread on the forum client)

## Example: 
  
'Nostr' community group is created. Other users create sub-community groups for topics such as 'NIP-Proposals', 'Developers' etc.
Community clients (forum websites) display communities in a forum like structure, filtering content as they see fit.

1. Nostr
   - General
   - NIP-Proposals
   - Developers
  
Spam prevention is down to the strength of the clients filtering.
